# CV as Code 📄

This project programmatically generates my Curriculum Vitae using Node.js and the docx library.

Why? Because as a developer, I believe in automation, version control, and treating documentation as code.

Technologies:

Node.js

Docx.js

How to generate the CV: npm install, then run node index.js. Replace the variables in the .env file before pushing to GitHub.
